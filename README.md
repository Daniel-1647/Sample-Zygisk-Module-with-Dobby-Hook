# Sample-Zygisk-Module-with-Dobby-Hook
A Sample Zygisk Module taken from Topjohnwu's repo where I have integrated the latest Dobby Hook and it also contains an example hook for the dlopen function of libdl.so
Also you can check out the gradle tasks where I have added some code to generate a zip file in the output folder so you don't need to manually update the module, each time you compile.
